# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Basic Solidity and Javascript was utilized in this project. The Contract deployed allows a set amount of ETH to be given to users randomly, specifically a 50% chance.
